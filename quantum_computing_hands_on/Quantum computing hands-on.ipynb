    "While it is true that Qiskit is a very popular and very good quantum software toolkit, there are some peculiar advantages that a platform like Pennylane has over Qiskit. As an example, it is higly optimized for parameterized circuits, as it integrates *automatic differentiation* capabilities to the quantum simulators, making it a lot faster when it comes to Quantum Machine Learning (QML) applications!"
